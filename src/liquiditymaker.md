### LiquidityMaker

**Purpose**: The LiquidityMaker contract is designed for managing and facilitating liquidity in a decentralized finance (DeFi) setup, specifically focused on providing liquidity with the Cookie token and WETH (Wrapped Ether) in the Uniswap V3 framework.

**Key Features**:

- **Counterparty Liquidity Provision**: Acts as a counterparty by providing Cookie tokens to the Uniswap V3 liquidity pool. This is paired with WETH contributed by users, creating a balanced liquidity pool.

- **User-Driven Liquidity Contribution**: Users contribute to the liquidity pool by depositing WETH. In return, the contract matches their contribution with an equivalent value of Cookie tokens, enhancing the pool's liquidity.

- **Lock-in Mechanism**: Implements a locking mechanism for the liquidity provided. This lock is typically set for a fixed duration, such as one year, to ensure the stability of the liquidity pool and potentially align with reward or incentive structures within the DeFi ecosystem.

- **Liquidity Redemption with LP Tokens**: Post the lock-in period, users can redeem their position in the liquidity pool in the form of LP (Liquidity Provider) tokens, representing their proportional ownership of both Cookie and WETH in the pool.

- **Slippage Management**: Allows users to specify a slippage tolerance when adding liquidity, offering protection against unfavorable price movements during the execution of the transaction.

- **Emergency Functionality and Ownership Control**: Integrates emergency withdrawal capabilities, controlled by the contract owner, for added safety. Utilizes OpenZeppelin's ReentrancyGuard for protection against reentrancy attacks and Ownable for managing ownership rights.
