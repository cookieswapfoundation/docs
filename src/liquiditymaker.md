### LiquidityMaker

**Purpose**: The LiquidityMaker contract is designed for managing and facilitating liquidity in a decentralized finance (DeFi) setup, specifically focused on providing liquidity with the Cookie token and other tokens like WETH (Wrapped Ether) and BLAST in the Cookieswap Dex (Decentralized Exchange) on the Blast blockchain. 

**Key Features**:

- **Counterparty Liquidity Provision**: Acts as a counterparty by providing Cookie tokens to the Uniswap V3 liquidity pool. This is paired with WETH contributed by users, creating a balanced liquidity pool.

- **User-Driven Liquidity Contribution**: Users contribute to the liquidity pool by depositing WETH. In return, the contract matches their contribution with an equivalent value of Cookie tokens, enhancing the pool's liquidity.

- **Lock-in Mechanism**: Implements a locking mechanism for the liquidity provided. This lock is typically set for a fixed duration, such as one year, to ensure the stability of the liquidity pool and potentially align with reward or incentive structures within the DeFi ecosystem.

- **Liquidity Redemption with LP Tokens**: Post the lock-in period, users can redeem their position in the liquidity pool in the form of LP (Liquidity Provider) tokens, representing their proportional ownership of both Cookie and WETH in the pool.

- **Emergency Functionality and Ownership Control**: Integrates emergency withdrawal capabilities, controlled by the contract owner, for added safety. Utilizes OpenZeppelin's ReentrancyGuard for protection against reentrancy attacks and Ownable for managing ownership rights.

- **Tokenized Liquidity**: The liquidity pool is tokenized, allowing users to trade their LP tokens on the open market as NFTs (Non-Fungible Tokens). This enables users to trade their position in the liquidity pool, before the lock-in period expires.
